    <h1>My Wake-Up Routine</h1>

    <p> First, I snooze my alarm, because I <em>do not</em> want to get out of bed.</p>
    <p> Here are the things I do in the bathroom, in order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Brush my teeth</li>
      <li>Use the toilet</li>
      <li>Wash my hands</li>
      <li>Wash my face</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After eating, I make myself presentable by changing clothes and putting on sunscreen.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.misshaus.com/default/all-around-safe-block-essence-sun-milk-spf50-pa-70ml.html">This</a> is my favorite sunscreen.</p>
    <p>After I get ready, I go to the kitchen to make breakfast.</p>
    <h2>My Breakfast</h2>
    <p>Here is what I usually have to eat:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Cereal</li>
        <li>Coffee, but <strong>it needs milk and sugar</strong> or I won't drink it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> I am the only one in my family who drinks coffee, because my mother believes it's <q>bad for your head.</q></p>
        <small>I think that's nonsense.</small>

      <p>My sister prefers to drink kombucha, which I think smells <s>bad</s> interesting.
      <p><dfn id="def-kombucha">Kombucha</dfn> is a fermented tea drink.</p>

      <p>After breakfast, I leave for class.
